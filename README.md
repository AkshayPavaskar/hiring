## Problem Statement

Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

1. Program starts, prints out an empty grid. 
2. The program then prompts for Player 1 name, followed by their preferred symbol; assigns 
a default 'X'. 
3. Same for Player 2 name, followed by their preferred symbol; assigns a default 'O'. 
4. Players take turns making their move. If a step is illegal or invalid, the program prints out 
the error and asks them to enter again. 
5. The game continues until it's over, when the game is over, it announces the result. 


### Level 1 (Terminal Based 3x3 Grid)
As a traditional game, mentioned above but only for 3x3 grid where Two players take turn to enter position

### Level 2 (Terminal Based NxN Grid)
Instead of using 3x3 grid extend playing board to 4x4,5x5,6x6 or any NxN grid. Programe should work with any dimension up to 20x20 grid.  

### Level 3 (Terminal Based 3D NxNxN Grid)
Extend solution to support additional dimension  3x3x3 first and then upto NxNxN where N is any number between 4 to 20.

### Level 4 (Expose REST API)

Expose this logic via REST API instead of using terminal. Make reasonable assumptions.

### Level 5 (Persist to Database)

Allow game to be saved to database MySql or NoSQL . So even if program restarts we can resume playing game.

### Level 6 (AI based Agent)

You can also make it Single Player game by designing Agent who can play as player 2.

## Evaluation Criteria

We will start watching Pull request from 7 January onwards. Once we get all pull requests from Centre, we will sort them based on below attributes of Solution submitted. 

1. Readability - Can we read code and understand what it does?
2. Correctness - Does it perform as per rules of games mentioned above?
3. Robustness - Can it handle invalid input without crashing?
4. Tests - Unit test cases which prove your logic works.
5. Extensionability - Can we change requirement with minimum changes and make code work?
